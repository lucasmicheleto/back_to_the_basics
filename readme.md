# Back to the Basics: Learning Algorithms and Data Structures in C

This repository, "Back to the Basics", contains my solutions to various problems and exercises that I've encountered while learning algorithms and data structures using the C programming language. The aim of this project is to strengthen the foundational knowledge of computer science by understanding and implementing basic algorithms and data structures.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a C compiler (like gcc) installed on your system to compile and run these programs. You can install gcc using the following command:

### Roadmap

In progress

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
sh build.sh
